Clear semantics matter for the long-term health of the codebase. Time will pass, team members will come and go, and corporate political turmoil will completely upend ownership. Throughout all of that, the code will remain. It has to be able to describe itself. If we don’t make it clear what we mean, then all of our intentions around what the code represents risks getting lost as the codebase changes hands.

清晰的语义对于代码库的长期健康至关重要。时光流逝，团队成员来来去去，企业政治动荡会彻底颠覆所有权归属。但无论如何变迁，代码将始终存在。它必须能够自我诠释。如果我们不明确表达意图，那么所有关于代码含义的设计初衷，都将在代码库交接过程中面临丢失的风险。
